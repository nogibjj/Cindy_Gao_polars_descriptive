# Purpose for this project:
1. Use Polars to read csv file
2. Write polars functions for calculating mean, median and standard deviation for variables
3. Compare the functions for the accuracy
4. Create data visualization (a boxplot) for variable Y
5. Create a markdown or pdf file for the summary
6. Use Profiler to compare between Pandas and Polars
